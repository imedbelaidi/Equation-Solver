# Equation-Solver
An Android app that allows you to solve linear, quadratic and cubic equations.

This application will help you solve the following types of equations :-
1. Linear equations in two variables.
2. Quadratic equations with complex roots.
3. Cubic equations and shows all three roots (including complex roots).

Also, an expression evaluator is included in which you can input expression and evaluate with the desired number of variables. It is equivalent to a scientific calculator.

Also solutions and results are displayed with high accuracy (up to 16 decimal places). You also have the ability to set the amount of accuracy you want.

The input in the all the text fields is not limited to numbers only. You can enter entire expressions with arithmetic operators and use functions like sin, cos, tan, log, and constants like 'pi' and 'e' can be used directly.
